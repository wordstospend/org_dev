This is the lexer/parser project for org mode

Org mode does not seem to be as unabiguous as we might like but that is fine.
This is just a first bite at the apple

* Code complete
** DONE Parser org.y
This seems to be mostly done I'm sure I've got some gaps but for now this
looks like it is good enough
** TODO Lexer org.l
This has a bunch of code but really needs to be from scratch. The current
plan is add stubs for all of the tokens that will need to be output by the
lexer and then to go one by one and add work for them. At each case we
should add a test case for that token
* Testing sweet
** TODO Testing Harness
We now can pass in a filename to the resulting org-parser but we still need
to add a bit more machinery, maybe a prove script or some such thing
** TODO Unit test
* Objective C realease
** TODO research and outline
