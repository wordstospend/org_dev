This is the lexer/parser project for org mode

Org mode does not seem to be as unabiguous as we might like but that is fine.
This is just a first bite at the apple

* Code complete
** DONE Parser

looks like it is good enough
** TODO Lexer
* Testing sweet
** TODO Testing Harness
** TODO Unit test
* Objective C realease
** TODO research and outline
