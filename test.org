but it won't
stop it
now were done
but not done witht he body
2) a dedent

the previous was just an endln
      ' that was just white space and now End of file



an end of line does not end the body of anything

it is the the start of the next thing.

header bodies go until the next header or EOF
list entries go until there is a
- WORD
- MARKER
- PRIORITY
- EOF
- STAR
- TODO
that follows and ENDLN
